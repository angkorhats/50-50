**Please send hat orders to angkorhats (at) gmail.com**

NB: For the sake of avoiding unnecessary spam I have not included a contact form- I hope you understand the above email is replacing what is in parenthesis with the @ symbol.
Also, I prefer not to use paypal or any credit card transactions online for cost reasons and security!

Deposit funds to bsb and account via your bank account for safest and secure
transaction, the details of which will be forwarded to you once you email your order.

If you would like to buy a [hat] (../gallery) they are _20 dollars_ 
including postage. 

All hats are same size fits all but there are slight differences in size because they are made without tags! If you give me your preferred size I will search closest fit.

There are large brim hats and long brim hats with snap up face cover for both
men and women.

**No refunds** sorry. 

**THANKS!**
