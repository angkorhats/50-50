description: "A couple of years ago, I went on my first trip to Cambodia where I was treated with love and respect. People would pull me out of the way of traffic and I was always being smiled at. Then this year I sought out to find people I could help and I found a handicraft group of disabled women. Now I'd like to give back, if I can!"

The hats are uniquely Cambodian and are worn by men and women alike in every field of work that requires hard labour. Alongside men, women not only raise their families and take charge of finances but they also work just as hard, in the rice fields, on the construction of roads and on building sites.

The hat is really a symbol of the strength and steely tenacity the people of Cambodia display on a daily basis.
