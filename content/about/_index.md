description: "A couple of years ago, I went on my first trip to Cambodia where I was treated with love and respect. People would pull me out of the way of traffic and I was always being smiled at. Then this year I sought out to find people I could help and I found a handicraft group of disabled women. Now I'd like to give back, if I can!"

The hats are made by women in Cambodia within their village to then take to town or travel to a makeshift home factory. A middle woman provides the recycled fabrics and materials for construction then sells them on to market where they go for as little as US $1.40 to locals or as much as US $6.00 to the occasional tourist. So you can only imagine what the hat maker gets!

The hats are uniquely Cambodian and are worn by men and women alike in every field of work that requires hard labour. Alongside men, women not only raise their families and take charge of finances but they also work just as hard, if not harder, in the rice fields, on the construction of roads and notably on building sites. Notably for the latter because the highest annual death toll occurs amongst women with no workplace safety measures in place as they make up 35% of unskilled labour.

The hat is really a symbol of the strength and steely tenacity women in Cambodia, by necessity, have had to have in a culture where only the strong survive and women are considered disposable from deeply entrenched notions of social order. Ironically, women are the power behind the nation in nearly every possible way and are at the centre of the family unit being integral to its survival.
