**Please send hat orders to angkorhats (at) gmail.com**

NB: For the sake of avoiding unnecessary spam I have not included a contact form- I hope you understand the above email is replacing what is in parenthesis with the @ symbol.
Also, I prefer not to use paypal or any credit card transactions online for cost reasons and security!

Deposit funds to bsb and account via your bank account for safest and secure
transaction, the details of which will be forwarded to you once you email your order.

If you would like to buy a [hat] (../gallery) they are _20 dollars_ at market and an extra
10 dollars postage if ordered here. Obviously the more hats you order the less
postage costs because for instance 10 hats could fit in one 500 gram parcel
and still remain only 10 dollars postage.

All hats are same size fits all but there are slight differences in size because they are made without tags or any uniform construction! They are created with recycled materials and that is part of the charm.

Choose a colour plaid - orange, red, blue and green with inside lining preference. Linings usually white, gold, red.

**No refunds** sorry. If the hat doesnâ€™t fit or suit you, give it to a friend!
Or if you find a mistake in the manufacturing, fix it as I do!! :)

**THANKS!**
