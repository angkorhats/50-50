**Please send hat orders to angkorhats (at) gmail.com**

If you would like to buy a [hat] (../gallery) they are $8 AUD dollars.
Postage for one hat is 10$ USD or 14$ AUD It is less if you buy more than one EG 50 hats would cost approx 3 AUD dollars postage per hat. So you are looking at 22 $ AUD for one hat sent from Cambodia to Australia.

Bank Transfer, details forwarded on confirmation of orders.
Allow a week for delivery.


All hats are same size fits all but there are slight differences in size because they are made without tags! If you give me your preferred size I will search closest fit.

There are large brim hats and long brim hats with snap up face cover for both
men and women.

EBAY has millions of these types of hats nearly all 20 USD with postage and some under 9 USD with free postage (very plain ones) but NONE of them have the unique Cambodian plaid and floral design or shape that is uniquely worn here!

**No refunds** sorry.
